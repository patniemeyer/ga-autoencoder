How can I improve the convergence of this genetic algorithm in training an auto encoder on MNIST?

*autoencoder-ga.py* - A classic GA implementation with selection based on fitness.

*autoencoder-es.py* - An evolutionary strategy that uses a sum of the entire population weighted by fitness (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03864.pdf)
